Welcome to **My Learning Lab** — a personal space where I explore tutorials, courses, and experiments from different learning platforms.  
Each course lives in its own folder, isolated with its own environment (using Docker or DevContainers), so nothing gets mixed up.

## 🌐 Learning Platforms

| Platform | Description | Repository Folder |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| [CódigoFacilito](https://codigofacilito.com/) | Hands-on coding bootcamps and practical web courses. | `/codigofacilito` |

## 📂 Repository Structure

```
my-learning-lab/
├── codigofacilito/
│   ├── curso-profesional-de-react/
│   │   ├── .devcontainer.json
│   │   └── notes.md
├── devtalles/

│   ├── nest-graphql/
│   ├── nestjs-reports/

Each folder includes:
- A `notes.md` file for personal notes or course summaries.  
- Optional `.devcontainer` setup for isolated development environments.

## 🧩 How I Use It

- 🧱 **One repository per learning platform.**  
- 🌿 **One folder per course or tutorial.**  
- 🐳 **Docker / DevContainer setup** to keep environments independent.  
- 📚 **Markdown notes** for summaries, code snippets, and reflections.  

---

## 🚀 Future Additions

- Add more platforms (Youtube, etc.).  
- Integrate GitHub Wiki for long-form notes or course reviews.  
- Automate folder templates for new courses.

## ✨ Inspiration

> 📖 **Colossians 3:23 (KJV)**  
> “And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men.”
